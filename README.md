# Tech Blog

## Description

The purpose of this Tech Blog is to provide a place for developers to write and comment on their experience with coding. Users are required to login in order to post their information, and comment on other people's work.

## Installation

Once you have downloaded the source code, please make sure you "npm install" the necessary packages before running the server. Also, you will need to set the environment variables as well, in order to access mysql.

## Usage

First, you will need to go into mysql and connect to the database.
Then, you will need to run the seeds, and then connect to the server. 

** At the moment, the most you can do is run the server, but you will be unable to see anything. **

When this app is completed, users will be able to create a new account or login. 

They will be able to then create a new post, and/or comment on an existing post.
